- **preparing** — Staff is preparing the order
- **ready** — Order is ready for customer collection
- **picked_up** — Customer has collected the order (terminal)
- **cancelled** — Pickup was cancelled (terminal)

## Types

Key types exported from the module:

- `PickupWindow` — Time window for a specific day of week at a location
- `PickupOrder` — A scheduled pickup reservation
- `PickupBlackout` — Date when a location is unavailable

## Notes

- Pickup windows are scoped to locations — you must specify `locationId` when listing or creating windows
- Blackout dates are per-location, not global
- Capacity enforcement counts only non-cancelled pickups
- Pickup orders denormalize location name/address and window times at creation for historical accuracy
- The module requires the `orders` module
