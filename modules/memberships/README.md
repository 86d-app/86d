# @86d-app/memberships

Paid membership plans for your commerce store. Create tiered subscription plans with exclusive benefits, gated products, and member-only pricing. Supports monthly, yearly, and lifetime billing intervals with optional trial periods.

## Installation

The memberships module is included in the 86d platform. Enable it in your store's `config.json`:

```json
{
  "modules": {
    "memberships": {}
  }
}
```

## Configuration

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `defaultTrialDays` | string | `"0"` | Default trial period for plans |
| `defaultMaxMembers` | string | — | Max members per plan |

## Usage

```ts
import memberships from "@86d-app/memberships";

// In your store configuration
memberships({
  defaultTrialDays: "14",
});
```

## Types

```ts
type BillingInterval = "monthly" | "yearly" | "lifetime";
type MembershipStatus = "active" | "trial" | "expired" | "cancelled" | "paused";
type BenefitType = "discount_percentage" | "free_shipping" | "early_access" | "exclusive_products" | "priority_support";
```

## Notes

- A customer can have only one active membership at a time
- Subscribing to a new plan automatically cancels the previous one
- Plans with `trialDays > 0` start memberships in `trial` status
- Lifetime plans have no expiration date
- Product gating is plan-specific — a product can be gated to multiple plans
- `canAccessProduct` returns `true` for ungated products (no membership required)
- Deleting a plan cascades to its benefits, gated products, and memberships
